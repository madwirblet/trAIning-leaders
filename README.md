# trAIning leaders -- CIS4914

*By: Madelyne Wirbel, Chloe Fandino, Harper Fuchs, Matthew Hughes, Chris Enlow*

This is our repo for our Senior Design project. Completed in Spring 2026.

## Basics

### When working on the project on your local computer

#### 1. Make edits to the desired files

**In the `/frontend`**

- `index.html` --> embeds the chatbot into the Thinkific platform, shell of the chatbot
- `styles.css` --> styling sheet for the chatbot
- `script.js` --> handles chatbot behaviors (open/ close chat, display messages, etc.), API calls to the backend

When you have completed editing the files in the frontend, run:
```bash
py ./bundle.py
```
This will create a new version of `thinkific_footer.html` to be pasted into the footer.


**In the `/backend/app`**

(Updated when we figure out LLM and API info)

## Important Information
